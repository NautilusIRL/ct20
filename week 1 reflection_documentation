I was *super* nervous to start this class - I remember next to nothing from my one introductory Python course, and worse, I didn't even recognize the programming language we were supposed to use. 
The second class on Thursday helped a lot, though- seeing that it was a visual coding interface, made for artists more than engineers, was a huge relief. After I was able to play around with the editor for a bit, I'm still a little nervous, but much more comfortable with the idea of trying to learn something new.
Here's my first-ever p5.js creation, and I look forward to many more! 


    function setup() {
      createCanvas(400, 400);
    }
    
    function draw() {
      background("rebeccaPurple");
      stroke("papayaWhip")
      strokeWeight(4)
      fill("#AEA2DE")
      circle(200, 200, 100);
      circle(75, 75, 50);
      circle(325, 75, 50);
      circle(325, 325, 50);
      circle(75, 325, 50);
    }
