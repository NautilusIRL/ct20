Ok! Week 5 done.
Pretty good week!
Started off making this transforming spiral thingy
https://editor.p5js.org/eremick/sketches/aQgaAAK4y
by forking the Professor's code from a class. The idea is to make the squares curl into a nautilus shell,
or a Fibonacci spiral, 
as you hover over them. 
Or maybe as you click.
anyway

we're getting there, 
with the help of the Professor's demonstration on Thursday,
but I still need to figure out how to make this figure *move*. 
That's a next week project.
