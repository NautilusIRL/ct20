Righty-o let's get into it!
So this week I worked on my Nautilus assignment. It started off as a fork of the Professor's code for one of the classes (I think the Thursday before last)

where I got the squares to be striped (originally blue and pink) and someone suggested it could be a shell.
*insert lightbulb emoji*
So, with lots of help from the professor, we figured out a way to approximate the equiangular spiral of a nautilus shell in HTML (it's not exact, but oh well)

but it's too boring! it has to curl. so with (much) more help from the professor, the finished product is ready!
