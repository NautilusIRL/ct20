This week's extra time was mostly spent working on finishing my clock project, which I just submitted! Previous versions and images used are all in this repository.
I also spent quite a bit of time in class working with Blender, but due to an apocalyptic crash + computer restart following the end of class, literally all evidence that I had ever opened the program was erased. Such as it goes, I'm glad we're not using Blender for the rest of the class. I've seen the amazing things it can be used for, but it's not for me.
